# ML-Data-Cleaning


This weekly project involved cleaning and formatting data for three Kaggle datasets in R: 

1. A large patient readmission dataset https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/predicting-30-day-hospital-readmissions (challenges included an imbalanced dataset with messy data and missing values) 
a) Creating and filling out Table 1
b) Create subset of data from initial dataset
c) Testing-training split from the subset (subset data is used for predictive modeling now on!) 

2. A medium sized patient laboratory values dataset  https://www.kaggle.com/c/gusto/data (challenges included vast number of columns along with numerical and variable formatting) 
a) Creating and filling out Table 1
b) Testing-training split of data
c) Format continuous variables to categorical variables 

3. A primate junction splice sequence dataset  https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/cs529-project1/data (significant challenges due to nucleotide format of data).
a) Testing-training split of data
